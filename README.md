# SMBPCG
We have devised a system to create a fitness function that will allow for more controllability as well as the ability to bring coherency back into these levels. We accomplish this in a two-pronged approach: controllability is increased by using a metric that measures how much leeway there is to perform a given action and coherence is reintroduced through the employment of a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)

## Geting Started

### Prerequisites
Installation instructions for PyTorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

We use pyjnius to wrap the Java emulator into Python. Cython is required to install pyjnius. <br />
TQDM displays a progress bar and is helpful for seeing how long the model will take the train
```
pip install cython
pip install pyjnius
pip install cma
pip install tqdm
```
Java 1.8 is required as it is used for the Mario AI compeition 2009 A* agent made by Robin Baumgarten, [A* agent](https://github.com/RobinB/mario-astar-robinbaumgarten).
